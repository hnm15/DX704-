Upper Confidence Bound is the best algorithm choice due to the large variety and distribution of the reward frequency.Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) uses confidence bounds to balance the randomness and distribution of the reward frequency and will be able to identify arm 2 as having the highest expected reward.Epsilon-greedy explores randomly and is too simplistic to correctly and accurately identify and focus on the 'superior' arms.Thompson Sampling adds complexity and does not provide accurate assumptions regarding the observed reward distributions.
